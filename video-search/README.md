# ReactTube App (video search app using youtube API)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This is an example React app from Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) udemy course.

The app uses the youtube API to get a list of videos depending on what the search term is. When a video is clicked, the details of the video will be shown.
