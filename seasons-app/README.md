# Seasons App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This is an example React app from Stephen Grider's [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) udemy course.

The app uses the geolocation API to detect your location's latitude. Based on the latitude, it will either display summer or winter.

## Running the app

Run `npm start` and then visit `https://localhost:3000`
